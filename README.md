# Exploring the Markov Clustering Algorithm as a fast and reliable heuristic for large graphs

## Overview

In this project we present the MCL-Exp algorithm, an extension to the Markov Clustering Algorithm for community detection. We then compare this heuristic to two others, namely the Louvain and Fluid Communities algorithms. We compare them in terms of running time (seconds) and output quality.
